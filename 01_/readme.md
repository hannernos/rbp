#### 1 Python is 'Interpreter Language'
    called 'Script'

    without compiling a program into machine instructions,
    An interpreted language is generally interpreted
    
    It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, 
    but instead, read and executed by some other program

    *hybrid*
        compile not whole code, just part of it

#### 2 unicode_ not ASCII
        function read num of unicode
            order('A') # 65
            chr(65) # A

#### 3 var
        int float
        str # no char
        list / dict
        tuple #a = 2,3,4, / a = (2,3,4)
        set
    differnece between list tuple
        tuple_ read only _ faster than list

#### 4 input
    input() # only input string , if you need int, transport 
    split() # space != enter in python
    map()
